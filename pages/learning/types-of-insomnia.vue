    <p>
      There are
      <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/insomnia/types-of-insomnia"
        >several ways to classify insomnia</a
      >. For example, some people suffer from <em>short-term insomnia</em> which
      may go away after a week or two, but we presume that our readers suffer
      from <em>chronic insomnia</em> that refuses to go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insomnia can also be categorised into
      <em>primary</em> and <em>secondary</em> types. Secondary insomnia is
      caused by an underlying medical condition and we talk more about this in
      the following section. While secondary insomnia is a symptom of another
      condition, primary insomnia is the root problem itself and it is not
      caused by any underlying medical issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way of classifying insomnia is by the way it is experienced.
      <em>Sleep onset insomnia</em> is insomnia characterised by one's inability
      to fall asleep at night. <em>Sleep maintenance insomnia</em>, on the other
      hand is characterised by one's inability to stay asleep. There is also an
      <em>early morning awakening insomnia</em> where a sufferer wakes up for
      the last time too early and is unable to get back to sleep. It is not
      uncommon to suffer from a combination of these.
