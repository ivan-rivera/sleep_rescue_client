    <p>
      As we've just learnt, sleep is vital to our well-being, so if you don't
      get enough of it, then is it really going to have a profound, irreversible
      negative effect on your health?
    </p>
    <p>
      While many studies do show that lifelong insomnia can indeed negatively
      affect your health, we recommend that you
      <span class="underline">do not</span> look into this research. You might
      wish to assess "what you are in for", but you are not going to gain
      anything but unnecessary stress by learning about all the negative health
      consequences associated with long-term sleep deprivation. Remember that in
      most cases, primary insomnia is a psychological disorder that is often
      fuelled by stress and anxiety. Short term consequences of insomnia are bad
      enough to drive its sufferers to take action. The mere fact that you have
      visited our website suggests that you are doing your best to overcome your
      insomnia. Hopefully by completing CBT-i you will not need to worry about
      sleep deprivation damaging your health.
    </p>
    <p>
      What you need to know now is that insomnia is a curable disorder and we
      hope to help you overcome it.
