      In the previous section we distinguished between primary and secondary
      insomnia and noted that in the case of secondary insomnia, sleep problems
      are symptoms of an underlying condition. In this section we'd like to
      briefly talk about common sleep disorders.
    </p>

      While many health conditions, like obesity, may negatively affect your
      quality of sleep there are disorders that directly interfere with your
      sleep. These disorders can be broken down into several general categories:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="text-highlight">Circadian disorders:</span> these disorders
        are characterised by a shift in your body clock.
        <a
          href="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-conditions/sleep/delayed-sleep-phase-syndrome.html"
          >Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome</a
        >
        (DSPS) sufferers tend to sleep well as long as they go to bed and wake
        up much later than most of us.
        <a
          href="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-conditions/sleep/advanced-sleep-phase-syndrome.html"
          >Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome</a
        >
        (ASPS) sufferers, on the other hand, tend to want to go to bed earlier
        than most of us and they get up earlier also. Both conditions tend to be
        treated with
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronotherapy_(sleep_phase)"

        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="text-highlight">Breathing disorders:</span> this category
        mainly refers to

          >Obstructive Sleep Apnea</a
        >
        (OSA). OSA sufferers tend to periodically stop breathing in their sleep.
        Those with OSA tend to be overweight, but not always. Loud snoring, dry
        mouth, morning headaches and fragmented sleep are characteristic of OSA.
        To be treated, OSA may require a medical operation, alternatively

          >CPAP</a
        >
        masks can be used to supply a steady amount of oxygen during sleep.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="text-highlight">Restless limbs:</span> two of the most
        common disorders falling into this category are
        <a
          href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/restless-legs-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20377168"
          >Restless Leg Syndrome</a
        >
        (RLS) and
        <a
          href="https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/periodic-limb-movement-disorder"
          >Periodic Limb Movement Disorder</a
        >
        (PLMD). RLS is characterised by an urge to move legs when at rest which
        can often interrupt sleep. PLMD, on the other hand, is characterised by
        involuntary jerky movements which may interrupt sleep. Note that it is
        easy to confuse PLMD with healthy

        but

          >they are different</a
        >. Similarly, some people might confuse RLS with

          >anxious leg bouncing</a
        >. Treatment of RLS and PLMD usually involves medication to manage the
        severity of symptoms.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="text-highlight">Parasomnias:</span> this category is
        characterised by abnormalities that people may experience during sleep.
        Some of the biggest complaints that fall into this category are
        sleepwalking, sleep-talking, nightmares and night terrors. Parasomnias
        tend to be
        <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/parasomnias/sleepwalking"
          >linked</a
        >
        to other sleep problems and therefore their treatment largely depends on
        the underlying causes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="text-highlight">Narcolepsy and hypersomnia:</span>
        <a
          href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcolepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20375497"
          >narcolepsy</a
        >
        is characterised by sudden and uncontrollable sleep attacks, while
        <a href="https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/hypersomnia"
          >hypersomnia</a
        >
        is described by excessive sleepiness and the desire to sleep longer than
        normal. Treatment of these conditions requires medication to manage the
        symptoms.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Whether you suspect that you may have one of the above conditions or not,
      we strongly recommend that you see a doctor about your sleep problems.
      Ideally, they would refer you to specialist or directly put you into a
      sleep lab for a few nights where your condition can be thoroughly assessed
      by qualified professionals. This website is not designed to help people
      with any of the above conditions. However, many people struggle to sleep
      even after ruling out all of the above problems. This is our target
      audience.
