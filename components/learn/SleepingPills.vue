    <h1 class="md-h1">Sleeping pills and natural remedies</h1>
    <p>
      Sadly, there are no magic pills that would help us sleep with no strings
      attached. Modern pharmacological sleeping pills are usually designed for
      short-term use only even though many people end up taking them nightly for
      years. Aside from various negative side effects that are specific to each
      active ingredient, most pills are highly addictive and if overused, then
      their consumers can develop a strong dependence. To make matters worse,
      one day, possibly years in the future, the pills may simply stop working.
      For that reason, sleeping pills are not a solution to insomnia, even
      though they might appear tempting at first. Nonetheless, in this section
      we will briefly discuss common sleeping remedies.

      Some sleep medication can be purchased over the counter without requiring
      a prescription from a doctor.
      <a href="https://www.webmd.com/allergies/antihistamines-for-allergies"
        >Antihistamines</a
      >
      which are commonly used to treat allergies can help to induce sleep. Note
      that even though these drugs require no prescription, they too come with
      side effects and should not be used for an extended period of time. Other
      drugs that do not require you to see a doctor (large doses may still
      require a prescription) include
      <a

        >melatonin</a
      >,

      and
      <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/tryptophan#TOC_TITLE_HDR_3"
        >tryprophan</a
      >. We've included links so that you can read about each of them
      individually. Unfortunately, neither of these options is considered to be
      very effective.

      Prescription hypnotics are usually broken down into two categories:
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine">benzodiazepines</a>
      (BZ) and
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonbenzodiazepine"
        >non-benzodiazepines</a
      >
      (non-BZ). While both of these are psychoactive drugs used to treat
      insomnia, anxiety, panic attacks and related disorders, non-BZ drugs are
      newer and presumably

        >safer</a
      >. Nonetheless, both come with an array of potential side effects and may
      be incompatible with other substances such as alcohol.

      Please note that here at SleepRescue, we encourage insomniacs to seek a
      non-pharmacological solution to their sleep problem and we will talk
      extensively about it next.
