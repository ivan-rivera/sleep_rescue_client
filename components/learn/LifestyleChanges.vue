    <p>
      Assuming that you've read and internalised previous section on tackling
      negative thoughts, we can now begin addressing the behavioural components
      of therapy. First, we need to make sure that your lifestyle is compatible
      with restful sleep. If you've already done some research on insomnia, you
      could have read about this topic already in which case feel free to skip
      ahead to the next section. However, without discussing how lifestyle
      affects your sleep, this tutorial would be incomplete. Consider the below
      list of lifestyle factors and think about what changes you could introduce
      in your life to facilitate restful sleep.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="text-highlight">Follow a sleep schedule:</span> if you go
        to sleep and wake up at inconsistent times, then you body clock will
        find it harder to know when it should expect to sleep. Don't expect your
        body to just fall asleep as soon as you determine that it is bedtime. A
        consistent routine (and weekdays and weekends) is extremely important
        and we will talk more about it in a later chapter.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="text-highlight">Exercise:</span> you've probably heard it
        all before that exercising is highly beneficial for your health. Among
        the many benefits that it offers, exercising is believe to improve our
        quality of sleep too. However, it is important not to exercise for at
        least a few hours before bedtime.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="text-highlight">Watch your weight:</span> as we previously
        learnt, obesity can lead to a number of adverse health conditions that
        affect sleep.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="text-highlight">Avoid naps:</span> you might think that
        napping allows you to catch up on your lost sleep and you are correct.
        However, it also decreases your <em>sleep drive</em> which will make it
        harder for you to fall asleep at night.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="text-highlight">Avoid certain substances:</span> if you are
        a coffee drinker, then consider switching to decaf. If you are a smoker,
        then consider giving up. If you drink alcohol, then consider limiting it
        as much as possible -- alcohol may help you fall asleep but it will make
        it harder for you to stay asleep.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="text-highlight">Relax before sleep:</span> you should not
        engage in any high intensity (mental or physical) activities at least an
        hour before bed. Consider spending that time reading, meditating,
        listening to music/podcasts or relaxing in some other manner.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="text-highlight">Limit screen time:</span> first, make sure
        that your phone and computer have a blue light filter at night. The
        light from electronic devices can wake you up. Additionally, avoid
        browsing through your phone when you are in bed. When you are trying to
        fall asleep, you should not seek stimulation.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note that the above recommendations are prerequisites for restful sleep.
      If, for example, you drink a lot of coffee, then CBT-i or any other
      therapy might simply be ineffective at counteracting the effects of
      caffeine and you will not be able to make progress. Some of you might
      object something along the lines of "but my friend is a heavy smoker but
      he sleeps like a child!". This may be so, but you have a sleep problem and
      you need to pay extra attention to all factors that could rob you of a
      good night's sleep.
