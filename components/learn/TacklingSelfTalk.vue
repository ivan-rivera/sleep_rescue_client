      As we've just learnt, the <em>cognitive</em> part of CBT-i is concerned
      with our thoughts and emotions. In order for you to recover, you need to
      learn to recognise your negative thoughts and counter them. Needless to
      say, you need to believe that the treatment will fix your sleep. Many
      insomniacs often get depressed and become highly pessimistic about their
      condition. Before you can even begin to start fixing your sleep, you will
      need to change your mindset. If you have an account with us, then you can
      use the <NuxtLink to="/thoughts">thought tracker</NuxtLink> to record
      negative thoughts. You will also need to record their rational
      counterparts. For example, if you catch yourself thinking "my poor sleep
      will torment me for the rest of my life", then you'll need to analyse this
      thought from a more rational perspective. You may then conclude that "this
      is a very common conditions and many people either completely recover or
      find an effective way to manage their sleep, so I can do it too".
      Sometimes, you might not be able to rationalise your thoughts. That's
      okay, just take note of your negative thought and come back to it later,
      you might be able to rationalise it when you get to review it.

      The idea of challenging negative thoughts is shared by all CBT variants.
      To help you detect them, let's look at the hallmarks of irrational
      thoughts that we are trying to address:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="text-highlight">Unrealistic expectations:</span> you might
        be upset or even angry that you can't sleep like a "normal person".
        However, it is important to remember that these so-called normal people
        also struggle with sleep from time to time, especially as they get
        older, they just don't think anything of it. Therefore, assuming that an
        average person sleeps well every night is unrealistic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="text-highlight">Exaggeration:</span> poor sleep can mess
        with your emotions. When people get emotional, they tend to exaggerate
        the situation. Consider the aforementioned example of expecting to be
        tormented by insomnia for the rest of your life. It is more realistic to
        think that one way or another you will find a way to manage your
        condition.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="text-highlight">Catastrophizing:</span> in one of the
        earlier sections we spoke about the negative effects of insomnia on your
        long-term well-being and our advice was not to concern yourself with it
        because this is one of the topics that people tend to catastrophize.
        Similarly, insomniacs may worry about their jobs, families and more.
        Insomnia is indeed an irksome condition if left unchecked, but you will
        probably not lose your job, nor will you develop a crippling, lifelong
        medical disorder because of it. Remember, insomnia is a very common
        problem and once you start talking to people about it, you'll be
        surprised to learn how many people suffer from it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="text-highlight">Hopelessness:</span> one of the ways that
        hopelessness manifests itself in people's negative thoughts is through
        the notion of being not in control. This is simply false. There are many
        factors that are within your control. For example, you can (and
        definitely should) seek medical attention, you can give CBT-i the best
        shot and you can resort to pharmacological solutions if all else fails.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="text-highlight">Fortune telling:</span> you may have caught
        yourself thinking something along the lines of "Tonight is going to be a
        bad one. I can feel it coming". This may translate into a
        self-fulfilling prophecy. However, the truth is that you just don't know
        but you are certainly not helping yourself by thinking it.
