    <h1>Types of insomnia</h1>
    <p>
      There are several ways to classify insomnia. For example, some people
      suffer from <span class="text-highlight">short-term insomnia</span> which
      may go away after a week or two, but we presume that our readers suffer
      from <span class="text-highlight">chronic insomnia</span> that refuses to
      go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insomnia can also be categorised into
      <span class="text-highlight">primary</span> and
      <span class="text-highlight">secondary</span> types. Secondary insomnia is
      caused by an underlying medical condition and we talk more about this in
      the following section. While secondary insomnia is a symptom of another
      condition, primary insomnia is the root problem itself and it is not
      caused by any underlying medical issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way of classifying insomnia is by the way it is experienced.
      <span class="text-highlight">Sleep onset insomnia</span> is insomnia
      characterised by one's inability to fall asleep at night.
      <span class="text-highlight">Sleep maintenance insomnia</span>, on the
      other hand is characterised by one's inability to stay asleep. There is
      also an
      <span class="text-highlight">early morning awakening insomnia</span> where
      a sufferer wakes up for the last time too early and is unable to get back
      to sleep. It is not uncommon to suffer from a combination of these.
