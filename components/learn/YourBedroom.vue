      In the previous section we spoke about lifestyle changes that you should
      consider in order to improve your sleep. In this section we are continuing
      with the same topic but this time we are going to focus exclusively on
      your bedroom.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="text-highlight">Make your bedroom comfortable:</span> your
        bedroom should be dark, quiet and at an ambient temperature. You should

        ideally, your bedroom should be reserved for sleeping and sex. You
        should not work, eat, watch TV or do anything else there. In the next
        section you will learn that it is very important to establish the right
        relationship between bed and sleep.
