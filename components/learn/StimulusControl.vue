    <p>
      Remember when we said that you should only use your bedroom for sleep and
      sex?

      builds on this idea further. Stimulus control aims to strengthen the
      association between bed and sleep. Much like

        >Pavlov's dogs learnt to salivate in response to a certain stimulus</a
      >, we can learn to become sleepy when we are in bed.

      How does Stimulus Control aim to develop the desired connection between
      sleep and your bedroom? It suggests several initiatives, some of which
      overlap with sleep restriction, which will be covered in the next section.
      The main idea behind Stimulus Control that you should take away is that
      you should only go to bed when you are sleepy (note: sleepy and tired are
      not the same). This applies even when you are already in bed. If you
      cannot fall asleep for longer than 20 minutes or so (don't look at the
      clock, just guess), then get up and leave the bedroom for at least 10
      minutes and only return when you are sleepy. Feel free to listen to a
      podcast, meditate or do something else that is relaxing and preferably
      does not involve looking at a bright screen. It may be counter-intuitive
      to get out of bed, but this is a well-researched method for dealing with
      insomnia and it is highly effective even though you will probably not
      appreciate it immediately.
