      Before we talk about the details of CBT-i, it is important to address your
      expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, as we previously mentioned, your sleeping habits change with age
      and it may simply not be realistic for you to sleep an average of 8 hours
      per night. Similarly, many of us
      <a

        >get up at least once every night to use the bathroom</a
      >
      without necessarily suffering from insomnia. With that in mind, it is
      important to set realistic goals. If you have an account with us, then you
      can use the <NuxtLink to="/goals">goals page</NuxtLink> to both set and
      track your goals. Your goals determine the definition of "recovery" for
      you, however you can (and should) take it one step at a time and set short
      term goals that would indicate that your sleep is improving. Even if you
      achieve your goals, you will still have a bad night every now and then,
      good sleepers get them too. When this happens, don't look into it too
      much.

      The second point worth mentioning with regards to your expectation
      management concerns the therapy itself. CBT-i takes time to work and in
      the beginning, you may even be getting <em>less</em> sleep than before!
      CBT-i is challenging and it will require commitment. You may also relapse
      in the future, in which case we recommend that you start at the beginning
      again. I, the author of this article have gone through it several times.
    </p>
    <p>And now we are ready to talk about implementing CBT-i.</p>
